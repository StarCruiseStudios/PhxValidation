# PHX.Validation
PHX.Validation provides argument and value validation utilities. 

It does this by providing a framework for defining concise, self documenting
expressions that check common conditions and perform an action based on that
condition.

## Set up
PHX.Validation can be installed as a Nuget package using the .NET CLI.
```shell
dotnet add package Phx.Validation
```

## Getting Started

Documentation and set up instructions can be found in the [PHX.Validation Repository](https://github.com/StarCruiseStudios/PhxValidation)
